    <h3><u> Sequences in Creative Technologies </u></h3>
<h4>Accelerated Creative Technologies</h4>
<h8> High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion of their undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count for both the undergraduate and graduate program in Creative Technologies. Students can then apply to the Creative Technologies graduate program in the spring of their senior year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the Creative Technologies graduate program. For additional information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the Creative Technologies Program advisor. </h8>
