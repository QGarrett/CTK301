                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica" target="_blank">This is a link</a> Bears are large, powerful mammals found in various regions across the globe, from North America to Asia. Known for their strength and adaptability, they can thrive in diverse habitats, including forests, mountains, and Arctic tundra. The most common bear species include the grizzly bear, black bear, polar bear, and panda. Bears are typically omnivores, feeding on a wide range of foods, from berries and fish to small mammals. Despite their massive size and seemingly lumbering gait, they are fast runners and excellent swimmers. In many cultures, bears symbolize strength and resilience, often revered as majestic creatures of the wild. However, human activities like deforestation and climate change threaten their natural habitats, putting some species, like the polar bear, at risk of extinction.
